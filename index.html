    <h3><em>Amidst rising anti-muslim and antisemitic hate crimes, gaps in hate crime data collection become imperitive to look into.
    </em></h3>
    <!-- Byline -->
    <h4>By Khushali Haji</h4>


    <!-- Intro text -->
    <p>With escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict in Gaza, anti-muslim and antisemitic hate crime is on the rise in the country. While data for hate crimes is collected nationally, dozens of large cities either do not report hate crime data at all or under-report the data to the FBI. Many states also do not have laws that recognize or protect victims of different types of hate crimes.
    </p>
    <p>The Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) of 1990, requires the Justice Department to collect and report data on hate crimes every year – crimes that are motivated in whole or in part by bias based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity. This data was collected by the Anti Defamation League based on the HCSA report, which provides the most holistic national snapshot of bias-motivated criminal activity in the U.S.. However, dozens of large cities either do not report hate crime data at all — or under report the data to the FBI. Variations in how states define hate crimes also cause confusion that contributes to the undercount.

      <p>“There is still much more work to be done. We suggest that state legislation provide greater conciseness and specificity to the law and courtroom procedures, be mindful of appropriate social science definitions, apply equal coverage to institutions, and provide victims’ resources and public services through legislation,” said Cassandra Atkin-Plunk, Ph.D., associate director in Florida Atlantic University’s College of Social Work and Criminal Justice. “By doing so, hate crime and its harms can be adequately addressed within the criminal justice system.”

      <p>
        In light of the rising anti-Muslim and antisemitic hate crimes, addressing these systemic challenges becomes even more urgent. Policymakers and law enforcement agencies must work collaboratively to close the gaps in hate crime reporting, enhance legal frameworks, and ensure that victims receive necessary support.
